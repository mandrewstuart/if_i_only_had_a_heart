Web privacy violations are out of control. Do we still value informed consent?

Web scrapers download the content of websites to databases and the market for prevention has become big industry. Whenever you perform a optical-recognition task, you are helping to compile and validate a database to train machines.

There are many tasks on which algorithms now outperform humans. These tasks include: playing video games, transcription, Jeopardy questions, lip reading, reporting news, and diagnosing some diseases.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence is guided by its data. We accumulate data about a particular task and use algorithms to optimize the performance of that task, but what about the task of respect?

Life-side androids are not far from mass production. Will they be humane? They will not, unless there is data that describes humane and inhumane behaviour.

This work describes privacy violations that occur within the browser. What kind of violations will occur when algorithms have legs?
